This year in Global AppSec Tel Aviv we will run, for the first time, an innovation fair for startups in the area of Application and Software Security. This fair is an opportunity for early stage startups (younger than 3 years, with less than 1M$ revenue and 10M$ funding) to pitch their innovation to the OWASP conference attendees. We believe this is a great opportunity for practitioners of AppSec to learn about new and upcoming technologies, and a great opportunity for the startups to get some initial exposure and market feedback.
We believe Global AppSec Tel Aviv is the perfect OWASP conference to kick start this type of event and tradition, thanks to the marvelous ecosystem of startups and innovation in Israel, alongside a long lasting focus of AppSec companies who started here, bringing to life some of the first and most significant solutions in areas such as DAST, SAST, IAST, WAF and more....

The Innovation Fair includes two parts. The first part is a one hour presentation phase, that will take place just before the closing keynote of the first conference day, where each startup gets to do a 5 minutes pitch of the problem they solve, the solution they built, the team behind it, and explain the innovation that differentiates it from what's out there today. After each presentation, the hosts of the event will ask followup questions.

The second part of the event will take place later that night, during the conference Networking Event, taking place at the Peres Peace and Innovation Center. Each of the startups participating in the innovation fair will get a spot where they can talk with the conference attendees, show them demos, answer their questions and provide more depth.

**Following this event, we will promote a survey amongst conference attendees to choose their favorite innovation, and will announce the winner in the 2nd day of the event.**

Below you can find the list of companies who are planned to take place in the event:
* Vicarius
* Protego Labs
* IXDen
* L7 Defense
* Cyber Intellectuals
* Salt Security - Winner
