title: Women in Appsec (WIA)
---

Encouraging more women to share their expertise!
The purpose of the Women in AppSec Program is to increase the participation and visibility of women (and other underrepresented groups) in application security. The OWASP Foundationâ€™s Women in AppSec program is for anyone who believes that diversity and inclusion is important to the success of OWASP, organizations and society, as well as an opportunity for women to exchange knowledge and build community among like-minded individuals in information and application security.

WIA builds opportunity for dedicated female students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, developers, and security professionals to expand their careers and collaboratively close the industry-wide skills gap in information and application security.
