The Women in AppSec program is for anyone who believes that diversity is important to the success of the organization, as well as for women looking to learn more about AppSec or who want to make career connections with like-minded colleagues. This includes female undergraduate and graduate students, instructors, developers, and professionals who are dedicated to information security or application development.

### Goal of Owasp Women In Appsec
